Requirements
1. Core Dependencies (Python Packages)
bash
pip install:
- SpeechRecognition       # Speech-to-Text (STT)
- PyAudio                 # Microphone access
- pyttsx3 / gTTS          # Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- transformers            # (Optional) For NLP (e.g., BERT for intent detection)
- flask / fastapi         # (Optional) For API deployment
- pandas                  # (Optional) For storing customer queries
2. System Requirements
✔ Microphone (for live speech input)
✔ Internet Connection (if using cloud-based STT like Google/Whisper API)
✔ Python 3.8+

3. Optional (For Advanced Features)
NVIDIA GPU (if using Whisper/Local AI models)

Twilio API (for call integration)

OpenAI API Key (for ChatGPT-powered responses)

 Usage
1. Basic Speech-to-Text (STT) + TTS
bash
python real_time_stt.py
Speak into the microphone → System converts speech to text.

Press Ctrl+C to exit.

2. Customer Support Automation (Advanced)
bash
python customer_support_bot.py
Features:

Detects customer intent (e.g., "refund," "tech support").

Responds with predefined answers (or uses ChatGPT).

Logs interactions in a CSV/database.

3. Deploy as a Web API (Flask/FastAPI)
bash
flask run --host=0.0.0.0
Endpoint: POST /transcribe (accepts audio → returns text + response).

 Overview
How It Works
Speech Input

Microphone captures audio → SpeechRecognition converts it to text.

(Optional) Use Whisper (OpenAI) for higher accuracy.

Text Processing

Intent Detection (NLP model) classifies queries (e.g., "billing," "complaint").

Automated Response (Rule-based or AI-generated).

Output

Text-to-Speech (TTS) responds to the customer.

Logs interactions for analytics
